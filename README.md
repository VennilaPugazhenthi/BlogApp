# BlogApp
This App was created using React Native. The user can add, edit, and delete blogposts and each blogpost consists of a title and content. The app communicates with a server using RESTful API. I followed the tutorial in this [link](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-react-native-and-redux-course/learn/lecture/15707428#overview) to make this app.

###### Server communication
1. Set up server of your choice.
2. Change `baseURL` in this [part of the repo](https://github.com/VennilaPugazhenthi/BlogApp/blob/main/src/api/jsonServer.js) to communicate with the server.

###### To run
1. Clone this repository
2. Go to the directory of the cloned repository.
3. Run the following command:
  `npm start` 
  (Make sure you have nodejs, react native, and expo-cli installed before running this command. You can use this [link](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup) to install those.)
